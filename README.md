Real-Time Train Schedule Monitoring • Passenger Information • Smart Alerts • Admin Control

An embedded railway platform information and monitoring system developed using the LPC2148 ARM7TDMI-S microcontroller and Embedded C. The system uses a Real-Time Clock (RTC) to monitor current time and compare it with stored train schedules. It automatically displays upcoming train information, identifies delays, provides visual status indications through LEDs, and generates audible alerts using a buzzer.



📌 Project Overview
